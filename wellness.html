                     <h2>Barking at visitors</h2>
                     <p>
                        To keep your dog from barking when welcoming visitors,
                        redirect them to a “sit-stay” or a "down-stay" position
                        before answering the door. Provide the visitor with
                        plenty of treats to give to your dog once they are quiet
                        and sitting.
                     </p>

                     <h1>2</h1>
                     <h2>Jumping on guests</h2>
                     <p>
                        Cue your dog to sit before greeting someone. Have treats
                        on hand and reward them when your pet remains seated.
                        Guests should ignore your dog until they have all four
                        paws on the ground or are sitting.
                     </p>
                  </div>

                     <h1>3</h1>
                     <h2>Excessive Licking</h2>
                     <p>
                        If your dog starts licking more than usual, get up and
                        walk away or redirect to something else. Giving them a
                        toy or treat when they stop licking you works wonders!
                     </p>

                     <h2>Sitting on furniture</h2>
                     <p>
                        There’s nothing wrong with snuggling with your pet on
                        the sofa but it’s vital that all family members
                        reinforce the same boundaries. Decide early on what the
                        limits are and stick with them for consistent training.
                     </p>

                     <h2>Pushing through doors</h2>
                     <p>
                        A dog bolting through the door is a dangerous habit to
                        keep. Always put your dog’s leash on before you go to
                        the door. Train your pup to sit and stay while you open
                        the door and invite them to go through when you both are
                        ready to do so.
                     </p>

                     <h2>Chewing</h2>
                     <p>
                        Provide plenty of safe and chew-approved chew toys for
                        your puppy or dog. While chewing is normal you can
                        redirect the behavior (and save your favorite shoes) by
                        putting your items away and having approved chew toys
                        readily available.

                     <h2>Me! me! me!</h2>
                     <p>
                        If your dog is displaying “attention seeking” behaviors,
                        ignore them. Turn your back and don’t acknowledge your
                        pet until they offer a different behavior.

                     <h2>Digging up the yard</h2>
                     <p>
                        Dogs love getting their paws in the dirt to bury food or
                        create a cool place to lie in the summer. If this is a
                        problem, set aside a small “digging allowed” area and
                        encourage them to dig there.
                     </p>

                     <h2>Aggression</h2>
                     <p>
                        Aggression is not common in most dogs and aggressive
                        behaviors often have an underlying cause. If your dog
                        lunges, snaps or bites another dog or person, seek help
                        from a veterinary behaviorist.

                     <h2>Fear</h2>
                     <p>
                        A well-bred, properly socialized and trained dog is less
                        likely to be fearful in most situations. Even so, any
                        dog can become afraid when in new or strange
                        circumstances.

                     <h2>Meeting other dogs</h2>
                     <p>
                        Dogs should never meet on a leash since they hinder your
                        dog’s body language and cause confusion between both
                        dogs. Instead, if you have a puppy, find a supervised
                        puppy playtime session to attend.
                     </p>

                     <h2>Stealing off countertops</h2>
                     <p>
                        Remove anything and everything from the countertop and
                        your dog will figure out there is nothing worth “counter
                        surfing.” This method always works!
